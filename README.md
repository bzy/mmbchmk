Benchmarking empirical analyses in market microstructure

This repository curates some most standard and commonly used empirical procedures in market microstructure research: signing order flows, calculating bid-ask spreads, depth, etc.
The purpose is to set up benchmarks in a transparent and accessible way, so that researchers can compare and cross-validate with their codes in their own projects.
The long-term objective is to reduce "noises" and enhance the replicability of research findings.
